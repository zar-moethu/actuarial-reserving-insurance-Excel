## Actuarial Reserving Analysis using the Chain-Ladder Method

### üß© 1. Business Problem

An insurance company's core challenge is managing future uncertainty. They collect premiums from customers today in exchange for a promise to pay for future events (claims) like car accidents or property damage.

A key question for any insurer is: 
"How much money do we need to set aside today to cover the costs of claims that have already happened but have not yet been fully paid?"

This amount of money is known as a loss reserve.
- If it‚Äôs too large, the company holds capital inefficiently, being unable to meet future obligations.
- If the reserve is too small, the company risks insolvency, impacting profitability and investment potential.
  
This project demonstrates the application of a fundamental actuarial reserving method, the Chain-Ladder Method, to estimate the required loss reserve for a portfolio of claims using historical claims development data.

### üìä 2. Data Source

The data used in this project is a simulated dataset representing a realistic portfolio of homeowner's insurance claims (Line of Business H3).
The raw data, which would typically be extracted from a company's database, is a detailed claims listing containing:

</p>


#### üìÅ Key Fields in the Dataset:
- **Line of Business**: Homeowner's Insurance
- **Accident Year**: Year the insured loss event occurred  
- **Development Age**: Age of the claim in months (e.g., 12, 24, 36)  
- **Claim Size**: Transaction amount reported at each development point

This raw data was aggregated to produce the Cumulative Reported Claims Triangle used in this analysis.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Methodology

The Chain-Ladder Method was used to project the ultimate losses. This is a standard industry technique that uses historical data to predict future development. The process involved several key steps:

#### üìê Step 1: Construct the Cumulative Reported Claims Triangle

- The raw claim-level data is **aggregated** by:
  - Accident Year (row)
  - Development Age (column)
  - Each cell shows the **cumulative reported claims** as of that development month.

</p>

### üìà Step 2: Calculate Age-to-Age Development Factors


Age-to-age development factors were calculated to understand **how much the total claims for a given accident year increased between two points in time**.

The formula used is: Development Factor = Claims at later age / Claims at earlier age

#### Development Factors Table Snapshot

</p>

As shown in the above snapshot, development factors are calculated for each accident year and each development period by dividing the claims reported at the later age by the claims reported at the earlier age.

For example, a development factor of **1.91** means that the claims increased by approximately **90%** between month 12 and month 24.

### üìä Step 3: Calculate Averaged Development Factors

To smooth out volatility across accident years and prepare stable estimates for projecting future claims, we calculate two types of averages:

3-Year Simple Average
The arithmetic mean of the most recent three development factors for each period (e.g. 12‚Äì24, 24‚Äì36, etc.).

3-Year Weighted Average
Averages that give more weight to years with larger claim volumes, which can produce more stable and responsive estimates.

</p>

In this case, both the simple and weighted averages are almost identical but in real-world scenarios, they often differ depending on claim volume and volatility.

#### ‚õìÔ∏è Step 4: Select Development Factors (Selected LDFs) and Calculate Cumulative Development Factors (CDFs)

To project future claims, we need a single Selected Development Factor for each age interval. In this project, we chose the 3-year simple average to keep the approach straightforward and because it was nearly identical to the weighted average. The data also showed no major volatility or trend, making the simple average a practical and appropriate choice.

Once selected, these factors (often called LDFs) help us understand how much claims typically grow from one development period to the next.

We then calculate the Cumulative Development Factor (CDF) for each age which tells us how much the current reported claims are expected to grow until they reach their final (ultimate) value.

üìå CDF = LDF‚ÇÅ √ó LDF‚ÇÇ √ó ... √ó LDF‚Çô

#### üìÅ Key Fields in the above table:
Selected LDFs show how much claims are expected to grow from one development period to the next (e.g. from month 12 to 24).
CDFs show the total expected development from a specific age to the final ultimate claim value ‚Äî in other words, how much more development is expected from that point onward.

### üí∞ Step 5: Project Ultimate Losses

The final step is to project the ultimate loss for each accident year. This is done by taking the most recent cumulative claim reported amount for each year (the "latest diagonal") and multiplying it by its corresponding CDF.

The formula used is: Ultimate Loss = Latest Reported Claims √ó CDF

Calculation for Accident Year 2024:

Latest Reported Claims (at 12 months) = $385

Corresponding CDF (from 12 months to ultimate) = 2.35

Projected Ultimate Loss = $385 √ó 2.35 = $905









- Data Aggregation: The raw claims data was organized into a cumulative development triangle, showing how the total losses for each accident year have grown over time.
- Calculate Development Factors: Age-to-age loss development factors (LDFs) were calculated to measure the historical growth pattern from one development period to the next.
- Select Average Factors: A 3-Year Weighted Average was used to select the most appropriate LDFs for projection. This gives more weight to recent years with higher claim volumes, providing a stable and responsive estimate.
- Project Ultimate Losses: The selected LDFs were used to project the current cumulative claims for incomplete accident years to their estimated final, or "ultimate," value.
- Calculate IBNR Reserves: The final reserve was calculated by subtracting the latest reported claims from the projected ultimate loss. This reserve is also known as the IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) reserve.
